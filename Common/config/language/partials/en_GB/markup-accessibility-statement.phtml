<h4 id="info-and-relationships" class="govuk-heading-s">Info and Relationships</h4>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>The visually styled heading "Help signing in" is not marked up as a programmatic heading.</li>
    <li>Important information is indicated visually with a "!" symbol, but because it is added via CSS and has no text alternative.</li>
    <li>Some of the page's heading structure is inconsistent and does not reflect the visual hierarchy for screen reader users.</li>
    <li>The visually styled "Traffic area" heading is not marked up as a programmatic heading but as a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, which has no associated for or id attribute. The content is also placed inside a fieldset.</li>
    <li>The page contains two visually styled "Safety inspectors" headings, but the markup is inconsistent and misleading. The first is not coded as a heading and is incorrectly titled, as the section actually describes the Maintenance Provision Rating Scheme (MPRS). The second is marked as an h3, creating an illogical hierarchy. All related content is also placed inside fieldsets, which are inappropriate for this type of information.</li>
    <li>The error summary (h2 "There is a problem") is placed below the page h1 and above an h3, which implies that "Newspaper advert" is a subsection of the error message.</li>
    <li>The radio buttons are placed in a fieldset, but the full question "Are you named on any other operator's licences as a Transport Manager, Director or Partner?" is not used as the legend. Instead, the legend "Other licences" provides incomplete context.</li>
    <li>The "£12500" heading is non-descriptive and does not relate to the page's main "Financial evidence" heading. The text "How much will you need?" should be marked up as the h2.</li>
    <li>When users select "Upload documents now", multiple input fields appear, but they are placed within several nested fieldsets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">WCAG Reference: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</p>

<h4 id="label-in-name" class="govuk-heading-s">Label in name</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The 'Nature of business' input field uses an invalid aria-label ('businessDetails_natureOfBusiness-error'), which is announced to screen readers and obscures the visible label. WCAG Reference: 2.5.3 Label in Name (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="video" class="govuk-heading-s">Video</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The advert video has no text alternative or audio description, which may prevent screen reader users from understanding the content shown. WCAG Reference: 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Pre-recorded) (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="focus-order" class="govuk-heading-s">Focus order</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    When the "You're about to be signed out" modal appears, keyboard focus is not trapped inside it, allowing users to tab to content behind the modal. WCAG Reference: 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="labels-or-instructions" class="govuk-heading-s">Labels or instructions</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    When users select "Enter the address yourself", additional input fields appear. The first field has a visual label "Address lines" but an aria-label that does not match, which is incorrect. The remaining fields use visually hidden labels, which may be difficult for voice-activation users who need to identify and reference fields such as "Address line 2, 3, 4". WCAG Reference: 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="page-title" class="govuk-heading-s">Page title</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The page title is "Directors", which suggests that director details are required, but the page actually asks for owner details. WCAG Reference: 2.4.2 Page Titled (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="error-identification" class="govuk-heading-s">Error identification</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    When users enter a future date in the date-of-birth fields, no error message is shown, allowing invalid data to be submitted. This can particularly affect screen reader users, who may not realise an error has occurred or what they need to correct. WCAG Reference: 3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)
</p>

<h4 id="unlabelled-input" class="govuk-heading-s">Unlabelled input</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The 'Trading names' input field is unlabelled. Both inputs on the page are placed inside unnecessary nested fieldsets, and 'Trading names' is incorrectly marked up as a legend, which is intended to label groups of related inputs such as checkboxes or radio buttons. WCAG Reference: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>When the page is viewed in reflow at 400% (1280px), the "Apply for a new licence" button becomes truncated and overlaps other content, making it unreadable.</li>
    <li>When the page is viewed in reflow at 400% (1280px), the "Add Transport Manager" button becomes truncated and overlaps other content, making it unreadable.</li>
    <li>When the page is viewed in reflow at 400% (1280px), several sections spill off the screen and become unreadable.</li>
    <li>When the page is viewed in reflow at 400% (1280px), the input fields spill off the screen, causing content to be lost or unreadable.</li>

<p class="govuk-body">WCAG Reference: 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA)</p>

<h4 id="input-type" class="govuk-heading-s">Input type</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The date-of-birth fields use the input type "select", which is incorrect and not aligned with the GOV.UK Design System. This prevents voice-activation users from referencing the fields, which should use type="text". WCAG Reference: 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (Level AA)
</p>

<h4 id="error-suggestion" class="govuk-heading-s">Error suggestion</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    When users submit the date-of-birth fields with missing or incomplete data, the error message "Value is required" is too vague. WCAG Reference: 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (Level AA)
</p>

<h4 id="non-text-contrast" class="govuk-heading-s">Non-text contrast</h4>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>When the checkbox receives keyboard focus, the yellow focus indicator does not meet the required non-text contrast ratio. It blends into the white background, and the checkbox border does not thicken. The contrast is approximately 1.3:1, below the WCAG minimum of 3:1.</li>
    <li>When the "Attach file" button receives keyboard focus, the yellow focus indicator does not meet the required non-text contrast ratio. It blends into both the white page background and the light grey button background. The contrast levels (approx. 1.3:1 on white and 1:1 on light grey) fall below the WCAG minimum of 3:1.</li>
    <li>When the "Remove" button receives keyboard focus, the yellow focus indicator does not meet the required non-text contrast ratio. It blends into the white background, giving a contrast of approximately 1.3:1, below the WCAG minimum of 3:1.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">WCAG Reference: 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)</p>

<h4 id="contrast-minimum" class="govuk-heading-s">Contrast (Minimum)</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">
    When users hover over the "Attach file(s)" button, the background changes to light grey, and the white text no longer meets the required contrast ratio. The contrast drops to 1.4:1, below the WCAG 2.2 minimum of 4.5:1. WCAG Reference: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
</p>

<h4 id="non-descriptive-labels" class="govuk-heading-s">Non-descriptive labels</h4>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
    <li>The page contains two "Postcode search" fields—one for the home address and one for the work address—but both use identical labels and button text. Because the fields are placed inside nested fieldsets that do not correctly announce the "Home address" and "Work address" legends, screen reader users cannot distinguish between the two inputs. Additionally, placing each field inside a fieldset with the legend "Postcode search" alongside a label of the same name causes screen readers to announce "Postcode search Postcode search".</li>
    <li>The "Attach file(s)" button is non-descriptive and not clearly associated with any group. The file upload component also does not follow GOV.UK Design System guidance, using incorrect labelling and styling across all upload elements in the service.</li>
    <li>The "Add" button is non-descriptive, and screen reader users navigating out of context (such as through the form fields dialog) cannot tell what will be added when activating it.</li>
    <li>The radio button groups depend on the heading "Has anyone named on your licence ever been:" for context, but this context is lost when screen reader users navigate out of sequence. The group legends do not make sense on their own, and the aria-describedby attribute is incorrectly applied to each legend, so the additional context is not announced.</li>
    <li>The "Select all" checkbox has a non-descriptive label, making it unclear to screen reader users.</li>
