  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You need to advertise the application if you are applying for a Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV)
    operator licence.</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    When you apply to use an operating centre, you must pay to advertise the application in a local newspaper and send a
    copy of the advert to us.
  </p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you have more than one operating centre, you will need a licence for each if they are
    in different traffic areas.</h3>

    Each area has a Traffic Commissioner who’s responsible for issuing licences. The Transport Regulator is responsible for Northern Ireland.

  <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
    Your application will be refused if you do not advertise the operating centre correctly. Readvertising is estimated
    to cost around £500.
